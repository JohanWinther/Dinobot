# Dinobot

Machine learning bot for Chrome's offline dinosaur game that uses [brain.js](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js) as the neural network library.

## How to use
### Setup
1. Install with `git clone https://github.com/JohanWinther/Dinobot.git` and then `npm install`.
2. Start server with `npm start`.
3. Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Play
1. Record your actions by yourself or hardcode a bot. Game data and keyboard inputs will be recorded as example input and output data.
2. The network is then trained on these samples.
3. Watch it play without any user input! Just like magic!
